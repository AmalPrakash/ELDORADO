 ONLINE TREASURE HUNT
Took in a template from webflow.io and redesigned it to my convenience.. 
The first thought was to design each page as unique as possible.. but I was asked to design this an hour or something before the contest, so I skipped the uniqueness part of it.
And that's why we have each page for each question. You could very well do it in about 2 pages, or in a single page..
